"Goodbye my friend"

Goodbye my friend, goodbye my dear,
you are forever in my heart.
Predestined farewell that is near
promises a reunion to those who part.

Goodbye my friend, without hand or word,
and donâ€™t let sadness furrow your brow,
in this life dying is not a thing unheard
nor is living any newer show.




This is the very last poem by Sergey Yesenin.
He wrote it in a hotel room, with his own blood, a day before committing suicide.
